UFC Fighters' Training Backgrounds and Their Impact on Fight Outcomes

# Motivation
This project aims to analyze the impact of training backgrounds (wrestling, jiu-jitsu, boxing etc.) on fight outcomes using data science methodologies. By analyzing fight records and training styles, I aim to determine if specific disciplines contribute to a higher likelihood of success in MMA.  Understanding how different training disciplines influence fight outcomes can provide valuable insights for analysts, fans, and bettors. 

# Data Sources
Sherdog, Fight Matrix, UFC Stats: Fighter profiles, fight histories, and training backgrounds. Scraping techniques will be used to collect relevant data.

# Data Collection Plan
Scraping Sherdog, extracting fighter records, training styles, and fight outcomes. Process and clean the collected data to ensure consistency. Merge datasets to create a comprehensive database.
