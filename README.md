# DSA210 Term Project

**Analyzing MMA Fighters' Attributes and Fight Outcomes**
In this project, I collected and cleaned MMA fighter data using a custom web scraper, focusing on physical attributes and fight records. I conducted exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing to investigate patterns between body metrics, dominant win methods, and divisions. Statistical techniques like correlation analysis, Chi-Square tests, and t-tests were used to validate findings.

For easier viewing, I have included a separate PDF report that summarizes the project's findings without the code sections. 
Both the Jupyter Notebook and the report cover the same analysis, graphs and conclusions.

Viewers can choose to either explore the full project with code in the notebook or review the summary in the PDF depending on their preference.
Both the requirement.txt and a python script to install the requirements are uploaded.


# Motivation
I enjoy MMA and wanted to explore some stats just for fun. Initially, my goal was to analyze
the impact of training backgrounds (like wrestling or jiu jitsu) on fight outcomes, but due to
limitations in the available data, I talked with my TA and shifted focus. Instead I examined
whether physical attributes such as height, reach, and dominant win methods correlate with
success in MMA. The project became a fun way to apply data science techniques to
something I'm interested in.

# Data Sources
I used scraped data from Sherdog.com, one of the largest MMA fighter databases. It includes fight records, physical stats (height, weight, reach), win/loss breakdowns (by KO, submission, or decision) and nationality information.
