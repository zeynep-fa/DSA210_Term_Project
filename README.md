Analyzing MMA Fighters' Attributes and Fight Outcomes

# **Motivation**
I enjoy MMA and wanted to explore some stats just for fun. Initially, my goal was to analyze the impact of training backgrounds (like wrestling or jiu jitsu) on fight outcomes, but due to limitations in the available data, I shifted focus. 
Instead, I examined whether physical attributes such as height, reach, and dominant win methods correlate with success in MMA. The project became a fun way to apply data science techniques to something I'm interested in.

# Data Sources
I used scraped data from Sherdog.com one of the largest MMA fighter databases. It includes fight records, physical stats (height, weight, reach), win/loss breakdowns (by KO, submission, or decision) and nationality information.
